Most of the code in the folder mulit_class and mulit_label are copied and used as baseline. 

The CNN comes from https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf. 
The TextGCN is from https://github.com/yao8839836/text_gcn.
The TextGCNCNN is a combination of both which was coded by Jasmin Saxer.

Changes are explained in the thesis.
